time complexity-relates the time taken by the program in relation to the size of program.eg:big-O notation
O(1)-constant time taken
	eg:indexing of array
	a[i]
	x<---(base_add+i*4)
*Membership testing on a 
	-list is O(N)
	-tuple is O(N)
	-set is O(1)
	---set is implemented internally as a hash table
	hash table membershi ps O(1)
	-dictionary is O(1)
