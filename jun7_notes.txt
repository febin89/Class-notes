*md5 checksum-used to check file's integrity.
in a list a=[1.2.3...]
	worst case:O(N) for 'in' operator --->called linear search
*32 bit---int is 4 bytes
*for a program,initially only a fixed amount of memory
Once started running,more is needed.
pgm has to request for more to the os.
*In c,malloc is used(Manual memory management)
local variable-when function starts,memory is allocated.freed when function ends
global-when program starts,memory is allocated,freed when pgm ends
data--locals,globals,malloced blocks
*if no free is used,memory leak occurs
*High level languages like Python,Java,Perl,LISP,Ruby-automatic memory management	
*AUtomatic memory management in C can be done using additional libraries
