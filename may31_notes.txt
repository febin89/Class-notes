*Aliasing does not affect immutable data structures
*a.sort() mutates a,whereas sorted(a) returns a new sorted list
*list comprehensions
	eg:[x*x for x in a]
  when using repetitions:	
	1)list comprehension
	2)for loop
	3)while loop
*tuple packing/unpacking-2 or more variables used while iterating
*dictionary,associative array ,map,hash-store structured data
*Dictionary is a mutable data structure.No ordering.
*tuple is immutable
*in Dictionary,key cannot be dictionary or tuple
Keys of a dict possible:int,string,tuple
Not possible-list,dict
*Keys must be immutable,Values can be anything
*Dictionary is implemented as a hash table.
	When mutated,the hashing process hashes to another value which is complicated

*dictionary comprehensions also present
