Python
*written in C
*dynamically typed very high level language
	-no variable declaration
	-Types are assigned at runtime
eg:ruby
C,C++ ,Java-statically typed (explicitly declare types)
*not used for very lowlevel programming and performance intensive appplications
*REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
*compilation and execution model
	1)compilation to byte code
		-.py file checked for syntatical correctness
		-converted to byte code/virtual machine code(wont run in any cpu)
		virtual machine makes language platform independent
		
	2)byte code interpretation
		-written in C
