du-disk usage
why we prefer c n c++ to other languages-most low level interaction with hardware in these languages
mozilaa rust is a growing language similar to C
cc -v ---version number of gcc
cc -E ---does preprocessing and macro expansion
cc -S ---generate assembly code in .s file
cc -c ---create object code in .o file
	.o file is not executable because the file is not complete
.o,.so---->/usr/lib
	contains libraries like printf etc.
	.o file has to be linked with standard c library libc.so
	(linking)
phases of compilation-
	1)Preprocessing
	2)Compilation proper 
	3)Assembling  -.s .o
	4)Linking---a.out

cc name1.c -0 name2 --store executable file in different name

Compilation phase is the most complicated phase
GCC-GNU C COmpiler
	optimizing compiler-
		c source code->assembly language code
		can be done in multiple ways
		this compiler chooses which is fastest
cc -03 --generates highly optimized code
	retargetable compiler
