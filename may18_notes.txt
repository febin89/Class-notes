*Shell is a command interpreter,it also behaves as a programming language
*PATH is a colon separated fields of directories
*Internal commands-built right into the shell
 external commands-have to load some executable files(eg:date,vi)
*Shell checks whether it is an internal command,if yes thenlooks up the folder given in the path in that order
*Shell will not lookup in the current folder by default ,only through those given in PATH

*add '.' to path-->shell will lookup in the current folder
 by default,no '.' in PATH.why?
*To automate PATH changes,add PATH to eport PATH in .bashrc file in login    directory

*'.' files are not shown by ls command
*why do you have to use shell script?To run commands faster,
	Many commands are lengthy
*When shell runs a shell script,it first creates a copy of itself(subshell)
* Script is executed by the subshell,SO when you run exit,you exit from the   subshell.The parent shell still in memory
*source filename-no subshell created,script is executed in the current shell
*Shell-a family of programs for command interpreattion
	eg:csh,ksh,zsh,bash
*bash-bourne again shell,derivative of UNix shell 'sh'
*ssh-for remote login
